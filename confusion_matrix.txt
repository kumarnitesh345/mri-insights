Chapter 5: Test Case Analysis and Validation
5.1 Introduction
This chapter presents a detailed analysis of the model's performance on specific test cases, providing insights into the practical application of the brain tumor detection system. The evaluation was conducted using a dedicated test case dataset to assess the model's real-world applicability.
5.2 Test Case Dataset Composition
The test case evaluation was performed on a dataset comprising 17 medical images:
10 non-tumor cases
7 tumor cases
This distribution provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance across both classes.
5.3 Detailed Test Case Analysis
5.3.1 Performance Metrics
The model demonstrated the following performance on test cases:
Overall Metrics:
- Accuracy: 88.24%
- Precision: 85.71%
- Recall: 85.71%
- F1-Score: 85.71%

5.3.2 Class-Specific Performance
Apply to confusion_ma...
No Tumor Class (10 cases):
- Precision: 90%
- Recall: 90%
- F1-score: 90%

Tumor Class (7 cases):
- Precision: 86%
- Recall: 86%
- F1-score: 86%

5.3.3 Error Analysis
The model made two incorrect predictions:
False Positive Case:
File: "30 no.jpg"
True Label: No Tumor
Predicted Label: Tumor
Confidence: 78.07%
Analysis: The model showed moderate confidence in its incorrect prediction, suggesting potential ambiguity in the image features
False Negative Case:
File: "Y90.jpg"
True Label: Tumor
Predicted Label: No Tumor
Confidence: 95.26%
Analysis: The model showed high confidence in its incorrect prediction, indicating a potential limitation in detecting certain tumor characteristics
5.4 Test Case Performance Interpretation
5.4.1 Strengths
High Overall Accuracy:
88.24% accuracy on test cases
15 out of 17 correct predictions
Demonstrates robust performance in real-world scenarios
Balanced Performance:
Similar performance across both classes
No significant bias towards either tumor or non-tumor detection
Consistent metrics across different evaluation measures
Confidence Levels:
High confidence in correct predictions
Moderate to high confidence in incorrect predictions
Suggests the model is decisive in its classifications
5.4.2 Limitations
Error Patterns:
One false positive and one false negative
Both errors occurred with significant confidence
Indicates potential challenges in edge cases
Dataset Size:
Limited to 17 test cases
May not fully represent the diversity of real-world scenarios
Suggests need for larger test dataset
5.4.3 Clinical Implications
Diagnostic Reliability:
High accuracy suggests potential for clinical use
Balanced performance across classes indicates fair treatment of both conditions
Confidence levels provide additional diagnostic information
Error Impact:
False negative (missed tumor) is more concerning for clinical application
False positive (incorrect tumor detection) could lead to unnecessary procedures
Both types of errors require careful consideration in clinical deployment
5.5 Test Case-Specific Recommendations
5.5.1 Immediate Improvements
Error Analysis:
Detailed examination of "30 no.jpg" and "Y90.jpg"
Identification of common features in misclassified cases
Development of specific strategies for similar cases
Confidence Thresholds:
Implementation of confidence-based decision making
Consideration of additional review for cases with confidence between 70-95%
Development of a tiered classification system
5.5.2 Long-term Enhancements
Dataset Expansion:
Collection of more test cases
Inclusion of edge cases and ambiguous scenarios
Development of a comprehensive test suite
Model Refinement:
Focus on reducing false negatives
Improvement in handling edge cases
Development of ensemble methods for difficult cases
5.6 Conclusion
The test case analysis reveals that the model performs well in real-world scenarios, with an overall accuracy of 88.24%. The balanced performance across classes and consistent metrics suggest reliability in clinical applications. However, the presence of both false positive and false negative cases, particularly with high confidence, indicates areas for improvement.
The test case evaluation provides valuable insights into the model's practical application and highlights the importance of continued refinement for clinical deployment. The results suggest that while the model shows promise, additional validation and improvement are necessary before widespread clinical implementation.
