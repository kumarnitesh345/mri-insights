Based on the code analysis, this project uses the following model and techniques:
Base Model: VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16)
A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
Uses weights from ImageNet for transfer learning
Input size: 224x224x3 (RGB images)
Custom Architecture:
Added custom layers on top of VGG16:
Global Average Pooling
Dense layers with ReLU activation (2048, 1024, 512 neurons)
Batch Normalization after each dense layer
Dropout layers (0.5, 0.5, 0.3) for regularization
Final dense layer with softmax activation for binary classification
Training Techniques:
Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained VGG16 weights
Data Augmentation:
Rotation (20 degrees)
Width/Height shifts (0.2)
Horizontal flips
Nearest neighbor fill mode
Learning Rate: 0.0001 with Adam optimizer
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Training Optimizations:
Early Stopping: Stops training if validation loss doesn't improve for 10 epochs
Learning Rate Reduction: Reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus
Model Checkpointing: Saves best model based on validation accuracy
Batch Size: 32
Maximum Epochs: 50
Data Processing:
Image resizing to 224x224 pixels
VGG16 preprocessing (mean subtraction and scaling)
Data split into train/validation/test sets
Categorical encoding of labels
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Training/Validation accuracy and loss plots
The model is designed for binary classification of brain MRI scans into two classes:
Tumor Present
No Tumor
The architecture combines the powerful feature extraction capabilities of VGG16 with custom layers optimized for the specific task of brain tumor detection. The use of transfer learning, data augmentation, and various regularization techniques helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability.
